              II&apos;m a full-stack developer based in the San Francisco Bay
              Area, California, where I live with my wife and two sons. While I
              have experience across the full stack, my true passion lies in
              frontend development. I find it incredibly rewarding to work with
              visuals and see the immediate impact of my creations in real-time.

              that made him look like a cloud. Sadly, he passed away at the
              start of 2024, and we miss him deeply every day.
